The idea came from an episode of *Tenchi Muyo!*, *Hello Baby!*, where Washu starts working on her computer but gets lost in thought and her screen saver starts and it's two simple little crabs walking across her screen.

I had a couple pillars in mind for how to write this:
 - Look as similar to the original as reasonably possible
 - Run with very few resources (this is only a screen saver afterall)
 - Render using the GPU

It is written in some very old (by today's standards) OpenGL. Someday, Apple will end support for OpenGL and force everything to run in Metal and I will have to rewite this in Metal (and maybe Swift too).
